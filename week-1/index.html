            <h2> Who am I?</h2>
            <p> I was born in Mexico, but immigrated to America at a young age.
                <br> I got married and immigrated once again, to Sweden.
                <br> Now that my children are in school, I want to focus on bettering myself and following a new career path.
                <br> I am curious to find out if programming is a potential career option for me.
                <br> I believe this free program is a great starting point.

            <ul>
                <li> Rehearsal/repetition/practice: I needed to recall and apply what I learned in the form of mini challenges. After
                    reading about a new tag. 
                </li>
                <li> I went to many websites and watched videos on youtube to learn more about the different programming tags. 

                </li>
                <li> Changing Mindset: I needed to change my mindset in regards to learning how to program. I always felt it was something
                    too difficult for me,
                    <br> or that I wasn't smart enough or didn't have what it took to program. But by changing my fixed mindset to
                    a growth mindset,
                    <br>I realize that I can learn anything, I just need to work hard to master it.
